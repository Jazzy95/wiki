## Guidelines for developers

### General

1. When you start to work on an issue, you have to **create a new branch** for that specific issue. Each issue should be implemented on its own branch.
2. The **main/master branch has to be used as base** to create a new branch
3. The branch name should include the issue number, e.g. **issue 56** should have the branch name **issue-56**
4. **Do not close or move** any issues
5. **Commit as often as possible**
6. Before pushing code to the repository, **make sure that you tested your work properly**
7. After pushing the code, **create a pull request** (PR) with the develop branch as base
